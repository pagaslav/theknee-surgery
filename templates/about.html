<!-- Continuation of About Us Section -->
<section class="about-section">
  <h3 class="text-center">Our Journey</h3>
  <p>
    Our story began ten years ago when a group of passionate orthopedic
    surgeons came together with a vision: to create a clinic that provides
    world-class knee surgery and joint treatments to the people of Newport and
    beyond. Since our inception, we have been dedicated to improving the lives
    of our patients by offering cutting-edge medical care in a compassionate
    and welcoming environment.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-center">Our Commitment to Quality</h3>
  <p>
    Over the years, we have grown and evolved, but our commitment to quality
    has remained steadfast. We believe that excellent medical care is not just
    about advanced technology and skilled professionals; it is also about
    understanding the unique needs of each patient. That is why we tailor our
    treatment plans to meet the specific needs of our patients, ensuring they
    receive the best possible care.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-center">Patient Satisfaction</h3>
  <p>
    We are proud to say that in our ten years of operation, we have not had a
    single dissatisfied patient. Our patients' testimonials speak volumes
    about the care and dedication of our staff. From the moment they walk
    through our doors, our patients know they are in good hands. Our friendly
    staff and state-of-the-art facilities ensure a comfortable and positive
    experience for everyone who visits our clinic.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-center">Continuous Improvement</h3>
  <p>
    To maintain our high standards, our doctors undergo rigorous retraining
    and certification programs every year. This commitment to continuous
    improvement ensures that we stay at the forefront of medical advancements
    and provide our patients with the latest and most effective treatments.
    Our team of experienced surgeons and medical professionals is dedicated to
    achieving the best possible outcomes for our patients.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-center">Our Community</h3>
  <p>
    Being a part of the Newport community is something we cherish deeply. Over
    the past decade, we have formed strong bonds with our patients and their
    families. We believe in giving back to the community that has supported
    us, and we regularly participate in local health fairs and educational
    seminars to promote awareness about knee and joint health.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-center">Looking to the Future</h3>
  <p>
    As we look to the future, we remain committed to our mission of providing
    exceptional orthopedic care. We will continue to innovate, improve, and
    expand our services to meet the growing needs of our patients. We are
    excited about what the next decade holds and look forward to continuing
    our journey of excellence in healthcare.
