  <section class="mt-4">
    <h3 class="text-center">Our Journey</h3>
    <p>
      Our story began ten years ago when a group of passionate orthopedic
      surgeons came together with a vision: to create a clinic that provides
      world-class knee surgery and joint treatments to the people of Newport and
      beyond. Since our inception, we have been dedicated to improving the lives
      of our patients by offering cutting-edge medical care in a compassionate
      and welcoming environment.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Our Commitment to Quality</h3>
    <p>
      Over the years, we have grown and evolved, but our commitment to quality
      has remained steadfast. We believe that excellent medical care is not just
      about advanced technology and skilled professionals; it is also about
      understanding the unique needs of each patient. That is why we tailor our
      treatment plans to meet the specific needs of our patients, ensuring they
      receive the best possible care.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Patient Satisfaction</h3>
    <p>
      We are proud to say that in our ten years of operation, we have not had a
      single dissatisfied patient. Our patients' testimonials speak volumes
      about the care and dedication of our staff. From the moment they walk
      through our doors, our patients know they are in good hands. Our friendly
      staff and state-of-the-art facilities ensure a comfortable and positive
      experience for everyone who visits our clinic.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Continuous Improvement</h3>
    <p>
      To maintain our high standards, our doctors undergo rigorous retraining
      and certification programs every year. This commitment to continuous
      improvement ensures that we stay at the forefront of medical advancements
      and provide our patients with the latest and most effective treatments.
      Our team of experienced surgeons and medical professionals is dedicated to
      achieving the best possible outcomes for our patients.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Our Community</h3>
    <p>
      Being a part of the Newport community is something we cherish deeply. Over
      the past decade, we have formed strong bonds with our patients and their
      families. We believe in giving back to the community that has supported
      us, and we regularly participate in local health fairs and educational
      seminars to promote awareness about knee and joint health.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Looking to the Future</h3>
    <p>
      As we look to the future, we remain committed to our mission of providing
      exceptional orthopedic care. We will continue to innovate, improve, and
      expand our services to meet the growing needs of our patients. We are
      excited about what the next decade holds and look forward to continuing
      our journey of excellence in healthcare.
